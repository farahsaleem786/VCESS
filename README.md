  - dbSNP
  - dbNSFP
  - IterVar
  - ClinVar
  - Ensembl Gene (ENSGENE)
  - RefGene
- **Automated Pipelines**:
  - Efficient retrieval and integration of variant annotations.
  - Data extraction optimized for clinical diagnostics and research workflows.
- **Visualization Tools**: Simplifies the interpretation of complex genomic datasets through enhanced visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `allel`
  - `myvariant`
  - `cruzdb`
  - `pyensembl`
  - `Pillow` (PIL)
  - `Tkinter`
